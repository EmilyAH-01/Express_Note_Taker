# express-note-taker

## Summary 
This program uses an Express web server, Node.js, and AJAX calls/HTTP requests to save, display, and delete notes entered by a user in the deployed web application. 

To go to the Notes page, click on the "Get Started" button on the homepage. To return to the homepage, click "Note Taker" in the upper left corner. After a note title and text are entered, a save button appears in the upper right corner; when clicked, the note title appears in the sidebar with a delete button.
